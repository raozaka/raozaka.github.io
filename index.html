                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an AI Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Hanyang University Seoul campus, South Korea, where I focus on cutting-edge AI projects, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation. I received my MS degree in Artificial Intelligence from the Korea National University of Transportation in Chungju, where I studied under the supervision of Prof. Jeonghwan Gwak. Before joining Hanyang University, I worked as an AI researcher at the Applied Machine Intelligence Lab and a small Korean AI company Decasight, engaging in various deep learning-based projects such as medical image classification, segmentation, surgical instrument tip tracking using AR, VR, XR and other Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems.
                    My research interests are broadly in the area of machine/deep learning, computer vision and AI. Recent several years, my research interest was mainly focuse on knowledge distillation, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, active learning, contrastive learning, etc. In addition, I have also conducted extensive researches on CADx and CADe systems.
